AI-Powered Anomaly Detection for Cybersecurity
This project focuses on building an AI-powered anomaly detection system for real-time network threat detection. Leveraging machine learning and network telemetry data, the system identifies suspicious behavior and alerts security teams instantly‚Äîfacilitating proactive threat mitigation.

üîê Key Features
Real-Time Monitoring: Continuous analysis of live network traffic.

Anomaly Detection with Isolation Forest: Uses unsupervised learning to detect unknown or novel cyber threats.

Automated Alerts: Slack notifications on detection of anomalies for faster incident response.

Visual Dashboard: Interactive dashboards built with Dash/Plotly for real-time visualization and historical analysis.

Scalable Pipeline: Modular architecture including packet sniffing, feature extraction, detection model, alerting, and dashboard.

üß† Tech Stack
Languages & Libraries: Python, pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn, scapy

Visualization: Dash, Plotly, Dash Bootstrap Components

Notifications: Slack SDK, python-dotenv

Dataset: CICIDS2017 and/or custom/simulated network traffic

ML Model: Isolation Forest (unsupervised anomaly detection)
